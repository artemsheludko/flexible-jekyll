I've created various data products that have been relevant to my personal life for budgeting, tracking utilities, and visualizing my LinkedIn profile changes.

## Sales Receipt Division Tool for Budgeting

This tool [Google Sheets Link to the Tool][gsheets-link] lets you itemize a receipt to breakdown it down into categories using a PivotTable. It even covers multiple sales tax categories. Where I live, commodities are taxed at a different percent than grocery items. If you budget into categories and want precision down to the penny, this tool works great! 


## Monthly Utilities Cost Tracker

I like to track my utilities over time to see if I need to adjust my budget or if I need to look into my energy usage. I created a [Tableau Dashboad for Monthly Utilities][utilities-tableau] that gives me a rolling 12 month snapshot of my Electricity, Gas, and City utilities (water/sewage/trash). The dashboard has interactive filters for adjusting the number of months visualized on the chart and table. It's interesting to see how my electricity costs trends with the average monthly temperature. I was curious if my gas bill and electricity bills would balance out to be a near level price throughout the year, but unfortunately, they vary too much, but it is insightful to know when to expect higher costs for each bill type. 

Recently I had to use this tool to demonstrate to a solar sales person that I don't use enough electricity to justify the cost of solar panels. It would have doubled my average monthly electricity bill to pay for solar panels!

## LinkedIn Profile Analysis Dashboard

As I became more active on LinkedIn, I got curious about my progress over time in gaining new connections and post interactions. I create this [LinkedIn Profile Analysis Dashboard][tableau-link] in Tableau to check my progress. I looked at first name frequency, where my connections work, the aggregatation of my connections over time, and messages between connections. This is a few weeks old already, but it shows how much growth I've had in the past few months. 


I have made other Data Products for other aspects of my life, like tracking my Retirement Savings over time (this year has been rough on it) or my PTO and Sick Leave calendar(on a government computer and I can't share it), which I used conditional formatting to highlight the current week and day and sum up my types of leave each pay period. 

Creating spreadsheets and tracking data have been an ongoing habit in my life. It's brought up some really funny conversations in social gatherings, as I've learned it's a very nerdy thing to do but I don't mind it. I am a Data Nerd and love to make better choices by using Data to inform my decisions.
