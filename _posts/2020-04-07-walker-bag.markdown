My very active mid-70s mom broke her tibia last week. She's not really thrilled about using a walker while healing, but she liked the blue-black plastic on the one she got. She asked me if I had any fabric in similar tones, to make a bag for her to carry her phone & other stuff. I *certainly did*. :)  

It was nice to be able to make and send them something they can use; they're too far away to drop by to help them out (and I wouldn't want to expose them in any case.)
