# What Are We Looking For Anyway?
Cyclistic has over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations throughout Chicago with various types of bikes, including assistive options for those with disabilities or who otherwise can't use traditional two-wheeled bikes. The focus right now is on the traditional types of bikes, which come in three styles: classic, docked, and electic.

## Member or Casual?
There are two tiers of Rider Type: Member and Casual. Over the last 12 months (November 2021 through October 2022), Cyclistic has documented over 5.5 million rides. The question being asked is:

### How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

To answer this question, I wanted to address a sub-set of questions that will drive Cyclistic's next marketing campaign to convert casual riders to members.
* How many members are riding monthly compared to casual riders?
* When are these riders using the bikes?
* What are the trip durations like? Average? Median? Max?
* Which Stations are the most commonly used by rider type?
