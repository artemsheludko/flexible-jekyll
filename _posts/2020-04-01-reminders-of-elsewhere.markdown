![A photo of the Convent of Christ in Tomar, Portugal.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-04-01-reminders-of-elsewhere.jpg)

I like taking photos, but I take thousands of them at a time. Too many. I never go back and look at them, let alone have time to do any post-processing.

Since getting stuck at home, I've finally taken the opportunity to post-process some of my old photos. The task is peaceful, slow, and brings a steady stream of pleasant memories. This photo was taken with my wife during our exceedingly late honeymoon in Portugal. It's at the Convent of Christ in Tomar.

I'm still very much an amateur photographer, and don't have much of an eye for it yet. A friend gave me some tips with respect to angles, perspectives, and colors, and this is my attempt to follow through on them.
