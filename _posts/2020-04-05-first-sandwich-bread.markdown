I've never been a great Baker and I've always been especially bad a making bread. For years I've tried and failed to make proper bread, but it never came out right. However, the quarantine blues and lack of options at the grocery stores forced me to give it another shot. Lo and behold, it turned out okay! We had sandwich bread and toast through the whole week. I'm looking forward to making more interesting bread recipes in the future :)
