AI does my machine learning coursework for me! Achieve the singularity with one weird trick!.

I took a module on machine learning in my final year of my MEng degree. It was an enjoyable module on the basics of machine learning but it happened to have a rather boring piece of coursework. This coursework simply involved designing and training a simple feedforward neural network to solve a classification task (predicting performance of catapaults from design parameters). This wouldn't be so bad, however, the work was marked based on both the performance of the model on an unseen dataset **and** the *simplicity* of the network (fewer parameters is better). Most of my friends simply manually searched architectures until they found one they liked, however, this is boring, repetitive and may not even yield a great answer. This project was my attempt to automate this boring coursework and solve the problem elegantly...

The project source code can be found [here][repo-link] .
