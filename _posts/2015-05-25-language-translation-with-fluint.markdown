### Integrate the translation process directly into the authoring workflow of your Content Management System.

## Why Translate your Site?

In an increasingly globalized world, fast and accurate content
translation is more important than ever. Consider localizing content to:


-   **Improve Trust:** Localization decreases communication errors and creates a relationship with the audience.

-   **Enhance SEO:** Localized content is full of SEO-rich keywords that improve discovery when users search in their preferred languages.

-   **Compliance:** Some local laws require website content to be available in multiple languages. For instance consumer sites in Canada must provide both English and French versions of content.

    
> In a survey by Common Sense Advisory, **56 percent of consumers say that having product information available in their native language is more important than price when making a decision.**

## Picking the Right Translation Service  
&nbsp;  

### Option 1:  Machine Translation
Artificial Intelligence backed translation platforms like Google Translate, iTranslate and others are a fast and low cost option.  

Use these services when:

-   Quick turnaround time is a priority

-   A “fair approximation” of the text is all that is required; an exact
    translation is not needed.

-   Low Cost option

> Choose Machine translation for general copy on your website, blog or newsletter.
 
&nbsp; 
### Option 2:  Human Translation with Translation Memory

Translation vendors like Lionbridge, RWS, and  Translations.com provide translation services that are ulitmately backed by regional, local human translators.  These platforms typically charge by the word, but other enterprise packages are available.  The translation experts are supported by technology like Translation Memory to help speed up the translation process and reduce the cost by not charging for the same words or phrases over and over again.

Human-backed translation improves on Machine Translation for:

-   Technical writing like Safety Data Sheets

-   Consistent tone and style

-   Context and understanding cultural references

-   Authors occasionally break grammatical rules in the name of
    creativity

    -   E.g. "We Don't Need No Education!" by Pink Floyd

> Choose human-backed translation when you have technical writing requirements or are looking for a more consistent, culturally accurate tone across your site.

## Structuring Your Translated Content in TeamSite

There are several options for the folder structure of pages, content items, and the URL impacts of different setups.

### Example 1: Single Site Structure

This is a case where the site’s structure is identical in all
localized renditions of the site. One way to accomplish this is to build a single page but
have LiveSite Content Services (LSCS) deliver different translated
content items to each page individually based on the language code in the URL.

### Example 2: Independent Localized Sites

There are times when it isn’t necessary to have the entire site
structure available in each locale, but instead have a subset of pages
that are tailed for a particular language. This is popular on sites that
want to appeal to an international audience without requiring a full
site buildout or redesign. In this case the amount of translated content
per locale can be easily controlled.
