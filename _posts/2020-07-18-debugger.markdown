# Introduction

POST GOES HERE!!!

- Discuss pain points with PDP
    - Manually connecting the debugger
    - No USART pass through
- Want to top arduino functionality by having full debugging in future dev boards
- Need to test debugger design before embedding it in future designs.

# Design

- Several Reference designs available online
    - Link to blog posts on ST-Link debuggers
    - Discuss Nucleo Board Reference design as main influence
    - Explain USART pass through and getting UART output from target back to computer over USB
    - Explain how we can program the MCU on the debugger with the ST-link firmware using the debugger we bought from STM
    - Broke out the ST-Link to the MCU on the debugger as well as ST-Link lines that go to the target.

## Schematic

- Mention hierarchal schematic design and embed files. Link to Altium documentation about ports and multi-sheet design
- Altium ports are like net-labels between schematic sheets.

## Layout

- Embed layout here

# Software and Board Bring Up

- Refer to blog posts with downloads to normal ST-Link firmware
- Discuss issues pulling ST-Link firmware with USART pass through support.
- Discovery of black magic probe firmware, link to tutorial used to flash BMP firmware.
- Demo Video and example connection through gdb
