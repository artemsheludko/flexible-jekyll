Your body, Your Diet
------

We’re back to another health topic. And today we read a bit about some popular diets some people follow. There are thousands of these, some for losing weight, some for gaining, some for living longer and the perfect ones for living shorter :)
We here, only look for a few of them.

### Ketogenic Diet

You’ve probably heard about the Keto diet. It’s been used for decades, mainly targetted as a treatment for epilepsy (nervous system disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures, and loss of consciousness). If you usually feel lost without breakup, drinking, or smoking, this is targetted towards you.
The diet involves reducing carbohydrates and intake and upping the fat intake. Yes, fat. Sounds good now? You only need Avocados, coconuts, brazil nuts, seeds, oily fish, olive oil to name a few.

### Atkins Diet

This one focuses on controlling the levels of insulin in the body. Blanking out what you studied about this back in the science class, and have a healthy family? I’m glad you’re like me.
If someone in your family is diabetic, I’m assuming you’d or say they’d know.
Insulin is A hormone produced in the pancreas, it regulates the amount of glucose in the blood. Why? Because of the lack of glucose regulation, i.e. lack of Insulin causes a form of diabetes.
Back to the diet, this diet is a low carb diet and also aims to burn fat and keep steady sugar. Also lessens you hunger/cravings. One size not fits all, and this diet has plans for different people. Details ([here](https://www.atkins.com/how-it-works)).

### The Zone diet

Oh Yeah, the recipe for illusions. But I’m afraid it’s not. The Zone diet aims for a nutritional balance of 40 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent fats, and 30 percent protein. Each Meal.
What happens? You lose excess fat, think faster, perform better, and some other things as well.
Simple procedure to follow. Keep a mix - Egg whites, fish, bananas, potatoes, corn, olive oil, almonds, etc.

> (from Reddit) If *you are what you eat*, then eating the same food twice is cannibalism.

### Vegetarian Diet

Hmm, does this diet need an introduction? Didn’t think so.
Let’s move on.

### The Vegan Diet

You clearly saw this coming after the previous one. Veganism is more of a way of life and a philosophy than a diet. Very simple rule - don’t eat anything animal-based, including eggs, dairy, and honey. 
This doesn’t bring any health benefits, it’s more of a belief that if everybody ate plant-based food, the environment would benefit, animals would suffer less, more food would be produced, and people would generally enjoy better physical and mental health.
Here’s my belief: If you like milk, drink milk.

### South beach diet

Go by the name it sounds targetted to get a sassy body and indeed it is. Created by a Dr. Agatson after he felt uncomfortable with the amount of saturated fat allowed on the Atkins diet Dangerous especially for the people with heart disease.
Enter south beach diet so your loser heart can still be taken care of whilst kicking fat and carbs out of the body.
This is a 3phase process detailed over [here](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/south-beach-diet#section2).
