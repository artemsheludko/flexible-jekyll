I’ve been taking daily walks through the University of Virginia Cemetery to get some fresh air during quarantine, and the official walking tour materials leave a lot to be desired. You can imagine: the cemetery itself is a lot of illustrious male professors and male librarians and male soldiers next to graves marked “wife of.” I thought I’d make up for that with my own Cemetery Tour, which you can find at the link above. More tour stops to come!
