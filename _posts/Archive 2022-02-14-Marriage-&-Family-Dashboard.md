## The Origin Story

Because I'm a data nerd, I have kept spreadsheets to track my life, including my marriage and family. After a few years of marriage and few kids, my wife made a comment about how she's spent a majority of our marriage with ~~parasites~~ kids living off her bodyâ€”pregnant or nursing to be exact I guess you'd call it. I took her up on that off-hand comment and made a spreadsheet to show her exactly how much of our marriage she has spent with a baby human sapping her lifeblood out of her. At the time it was something like 82%.

Ten years in, we now have 5 kids between the ages of 14 months and 105 months (8 years 7 months, for semi-normal age reckoning). The table based spreadsheet of dates and numbers was rather dull and was too much to process. I decided needed a dashboard to share with people instead. 

## Behold! The Marriage & Family Dashboard!

## Explanation

For every given day on the Autonomy plot, that is the percentage of our marriage my wife has spent being pregnant, nursing, or independent of ~~parasites~~ children needing her body. She's _currently_ on an uptick on her indepence! I know, the way I said _currently_ sounds sus, I feel it too. 

Next we have the obvious number of kids and their ages. Last, the number of kids in diapers in a given month. Each color of block is the next kid and how long they've been in diapers. So. Many. Diapers.

## Question Speed Round:
* Yes, we got engaged after _only_ 5 weeks of dating
* Yes, we got married after _only_ 4.5 months of dating
* Yes, we have gone through a lot of diapers
* Yes, my wife is tired
* Yes, we know what causes pregancy and have chosen to have each of these kiddos
* No. I know what you're thinking, but no. Just no. Stop.
