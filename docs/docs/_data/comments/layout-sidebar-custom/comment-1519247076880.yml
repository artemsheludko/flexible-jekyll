message: "Hey. I'm a newbie to github pages and jekyll, but I am liking the setup and loving your theme!\r\n\r\nI have an image that I want to add to the sidebar, but it is a little bit too big. Is there some way I can resize the image in the sidebar YAML Front Matter without needing another copy of it in github? I know I could resize it myself if I was adding it to the body of the text, but I can't find a way to do it in the YAML Front Matter.\r\nThx"
