I"Ø<p>Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb disposal robot.</p>

<p>This is my first blog post on my website, so Iâ€™ll kick things off by going over one of my previous projects from my undergrad (MEng Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London), where I worked in a pair to develop the software for a miniature bomb disposal robot. This robot was developed on a two-week timeframe and can locate a bomb by scanning for suspicious IR activity, scan the suspicious device for an RFID disarm code and return home. Here, I will distill 5 lessons which I hope will be useful to anyone starting to learn embedded C programming.</p>
