<p>The purpose of the 555 timer-based LED matrix animations project (referred to in
this report as the “TBMA project”) was to demonstrate how a 555 timer could
still be used in the context of microcontrollers, as well as improve programming
skills and understanding of the 595 shift register.</p>

<p>3 key engineering skills were improved upon in the TBMA project:</p>

<p>Programming skills were improved as a result of having to program a smaller
microcontroller with less SRAM and program space to work with, as well as having
to program two daisy chained shift registers to display the desired images on
the LED matrix. Soldering skills were highly improved upon during this project
due to the fact that all of the columns on the half + size breadboard PCB were
utilized in the circuit, thereby requiring an extensive amount of soldering and
leaving little room for error in the soldering process. Circuit skills were also
refined during this project as the project required extensive wiring and
troubleshooting of the circuit and less attention to the code.</p>
