<p>The purpose of the Automatic Night Light Project (referred to in this report as
the “ANL” and the “ANL Project”) was to develop integral building skills and key
circuit troubleshooting skills with the use of a digital multi-meter (“DMM”).
These skills turned the ANL into an exciting product enclosed in a fun chassis.
There were two key skills acquired by the ANL Project. The first skill which was
acquired related to building and craftsmanship. This skill was required to mount
the ANL circuit into a model car chassis. Mounting the circuit into a model
Ferrari with the two night lights as headlights proved to be more challenging
than originally conceived. This part of the project required an understanding of
how the circuit worked, together with numerous modifications to the car chassis
to house the circuit. The second skill was troubleshooting. On the first attempt
to test the ANL circuit once it was mounted into the car chassis, the circuit
failed. The failed ANL circuit required serious troubleshooting of the wiring,
circuit board and components in order to make it function.</p>

<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>

<p>The ANL circuit consists of two LEDs, a transistor, a potentiometer and a Light
Dependant Resistor (“LDR”). The circuit works as an ANL due to the presence of
the LDR. Specifically, the LDR goes up when there is more light in the room and
down when there is less light. This means that the two LEDs only power on when
there is low light. The LDR is connected to the base pin of the transistor and
the LEDs are connected to the emitter pin of the transistor. When the transistor
is set up in this manner, the LEDs are only provided with electricity when the
LDR’s resistance is low enough to actuate the base pin of the transistor feeding
the LED’s electricity.</p>

<p>The first step to building the ANL circuit was prototyping the circuit on a
breadboard. This involved a careful inspection of the circuit diagram and
translating the diagram onto the breadboard.</p>

<p>The second step was soldering the wires for the components of the circuit to the
board. This step was particularly challenging as it also required reducing the
size of the circuit board in order to accommodate it into the hood of the model
car chassis, as well as routing the wires through the chassis.</p>

<p>The third step was mounting all the components into the chassis and connecting
them to the circuit board. The components were connected to the circuit board
with the wires that had already been pre-soldered to the circuit board. Once all
the components were connected and a first attempt was made to test the ANL
circuit, the circuit failed. At this point, troubleshooting commenced. The
circuit was tested with a DMM by using the continuity function. This function
checks if electricity is flowing between the two points the DMM is connected to.
After an arduous process of testing and checking all connection points of the
circuit, it was discovered that a wire connected to the potentiometer got
disconnected from the circuit board. After resoldering the wire to the circuit
board, the ANL circuit was tested and proved to function correctly. Once a
functioning ANL circuit was achieved, the building process was concluded with
cable management and the mounting of the LEDs and power jack.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In conclusion, the Automatic Night Light Project was very challenging but
rewarding. The ANL project also developed the two key skills of building and
troubleshooting with a DMM. The result was a customized awesome looking night
light.</p>
