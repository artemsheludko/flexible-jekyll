<p>The purpose of the BiColor LED Matrix Project (referred to in this report as the
“BCLM”) is to improve the abilities of grade 11 ACES students in utilizing
registers and bitwise operators through mid-level C programming. The BCLM
project also serves as an opportunity for grade 11 students to be introduced to
lower level programming, which will be further expanded upon in grade 12.</p>

<p>The first skill obtained in the BCLM project is the use of various bitwise
operators such as left shift, right shift, bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise
NOT. The use of these operators gives lower level access to the registers of the
microcontroller and therefore makes for more efficient programs.</p>

<p>The second skill acquired in the BCLM project is register manipulation on a
microcontroller, which was used to form images on the LED Matrix and will be a
very important skill for students who pursue the grade 12 ACES course.</p>

<p>Lastly, the essential skill of soldering is improved upon in the BCLM project as
the BiColor LED Matrix used for the project is hand soldered.</p>

<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>

<p>The BCLM project consists of a 4x4 BiColor LED Matrix and an ATtiny84
microcontroller. 8 digital pins are required to control the LED Matrix. The
ATtiny84 has two ports: PORTA and PORTB. The LED Matrix is hooked up to PORTA in
the circuit as PORTA holds a full 8 pins on ATtiny84 while PORTB does not. By
hooking up the LED Matrix to PORTA, the whole matrix can be controlled from one
register. The fact that the LED Matrix can be controlled from one register is
very useful when programming since students have to use register manipulation
instead of Arduino functions like digitalWrite(). The construction of the BCLM
project is broken up into the following 3 steps; soldering and circuit
construction, animation planning and programming of the aforementioned
animations.</p>

<p>The first step of the BCLM project’s construction was to solder the LED Matrix.
The soldering process proved to be difficult as the legs of each LED had to be
properly insulated with heat shrink to prevent contact between different LED
leads that would cause a short circuit. In instances where heat shrink was
omitted by the undersigned in error, the risk of a short circuit from leads of
two different LEDs accidentally connecting was somewhat alleviated by using
pliers to create the largest distance between leads as possible.</p>
