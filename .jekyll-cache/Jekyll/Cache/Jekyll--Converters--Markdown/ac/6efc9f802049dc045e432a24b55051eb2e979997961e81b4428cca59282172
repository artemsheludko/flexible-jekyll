I"á<p>Hello again and welcome to the first post of the multi-part seriesâ€¦ Building a blog site.</p>

<p>In this series weâ€™ll be looking at how one can build their own blog site through varying degrees of effort, cost, and technical experience. Weâ€™ll cover building a quick and simple site hosted on Github pages, right the way through to a self hosted cloud based blog site complete with custom domain, deployment pipeline and automatic package updates for added security.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Editors Note:</em></strong>  Throughout this series we will be using the phrase â€œBlog siteâ€ but the learnings in this series can apply to any Jekyll based site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Part 1: On the cheap cheap, weâ€™ll cover how you can build a simple Jekyll based blog site, hosted for free on Github pages, without needing to know anything about coding or software development. All youâ€™ll need is a computer, a <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Github account</a> and a little bit of knowledge about <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>
<p>Before we delve too far into building the site, you first need to ask yourselves <em>â€œWhat sort of blog site do I want?â€</em>. Do you even want to build a blog? Perhaps you want a portfolio of your photography, an online CV with demos of your work, or maybe you just want a small single page site with a little bit of text. In the end, what you decide upon will determine how much work and time is required to get your site up and running, so itâ€™s best to answer sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><strong>Donâ€™t rush, take your time. Think about it over a cup of tea or coffee, Iâ€™ll still be here when youâ€™ve decided</strong>.</p>

<p>If after much contemplation you have decided you only want/need a single page thatâ€™s awesome. This will be much quicker and easier for you. Iâ€™d recommend checking out Githubâ€™s very own <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/">step-by-step guide</a>. It contains everything you need to know to get your site up and running using one of their curated single page jekyll themes. Follow this and youâ€™ll have your content hosted in no time.</p>

<p>For my Blog, Portfolio and CV peeps, <em>or those who donâ€™t like the Github themes</em>, letâ€™s keep going.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-theme">Choose your theme!</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re anything like me you feel that aesthetics are important, <em>perhaps overly so</em>. That is why I find the best way to start your blog site is to do a little theme shopping. If you want you can just Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jekyll+themes">jekyll themes</a> but if you donâ€™t want to browse through a bunch of random sites, hereâ€™s a few I searched earlierâ€¦</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">jekyllthemes.org/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">jekyllthemes.io/free</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/free/">jekyll-themes.com/free/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When you find your dream theme hold onto the page, youâ€™ll need it to navigate to the Github repository. Look for a button or link that mentions Github, Repository or Homepage, you should be taken to a page like this.</p>
