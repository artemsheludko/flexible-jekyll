I"ò <p>Hello again and welcome to the first post of the multi-part seriesâ€¦ Building a blog site.</p>

<p>In this series weâ€™ll be looking at how one can build their own blog site through varying degrees of effort, cost, and technical experience. Weâ€™ll cover building a quick and simple site hosted on Github pages, right the way through to a self hosted cloud based blog site complete with custom domain, deployment pipeline and automatic package updates for added security.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Editors Note:</em></strong>  Throughout this series we will be using the phrase â€œBlog siteâ€ but the learnings in this series can apply to any Jekyll based site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Part 1: On the cheap cheap, weâ€™ll cover how you can build a simple Jekyll based blog site, hosted for free on Github pages, without needing to know anything about coding or software development. All youâ€™ll need is a computer, a <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Github account</a> and a little bit of knowledge about <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin.</h2>
<p>Before we delve too far into building the site, you first need to ask yourselves <em>â€œWhat sort of blog site do I want?â€</em>. Do you even want to build a blog? Perhaps you want a portfolio of your photography, an online CV with demos of your work, or maybe you just want a small single page site with a little bit of text. In the end, what you decide upon will determine how much work and time is required to get your site up and running, so itâ€™s best to answer sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><em>Donâ€™t rush, take your time. Think about it over a cup of tea or coffee, Iâ€™ll still be here when youâ€™ve decided</em>.</p>

<p>If after much contemplation you have decided you only want/need a single page thatâ€™s awesome. This will be much quicker and easier for you. Iâ€™d recommend checking out Githubâ€™s very own <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/">step-by-step guide</a>. It contains everything you need to know to get your site up and running using one of their curated single page jekyll themes. Follow this and youâ€™ll have your content hosted in no time.</p>

<p>For my Blog, Portfolio and CV peeps, <em>or those who donâ€™t like the Github default themes</em>, letâ€™s keep going.</p>

<h2 id="finding-your-dream-theme">Finding your dream theme.</h2>
<p>If youâ€™re anything like me you feel that aesthetics are important, <em>perhaps overly so</em>. That is why I find the best way to start your blog site is to do a little theme shopping. If you want you can just Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jekyll+themes">jekyll themes</a> but if you donâ€™t want to browse through a bunch of random sites, hereâ€™s a few I searched earlierâ€¦</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">jekyllthemes.org/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">jekyllthemes.io/free</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/free/">jekyll-themes.com/free/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When you find your dream theme hold onto the page, youâ€™ll need it to navigate to the Github repository. Look for a button or link that mentions Github, Repository or Homepage, you should be taken to a page like this.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-1.png"><img src="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-1.png" alt="Theme's Github repository" class="page-embedded-image" /></a></p>

<p>For the rest of this post Iâ€™ll be using the <strong><a href="https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">Clean Blog</a></strong> Jekyll theme but donâ€™t worry, everything shown here <em>should</em> be compatible with most other themes.</p>

<h2 id="forkward-unto-github"><em>Fork</em>ward unto Github.</h2>
<p>Now that your theme is all sorted you can begin actually building your blog site. At the top right of your chosen themes Github repository you should see a little <strong>â€œforkâ€</strong> button.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-2.png"><img src="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-2.png" alt="The fork button" class="page-embedded-image" /></a></p>

<p>Click it and youâ€™ll either be taken to a sign-up/sign-in page <em>or</em> youâ€™ll have successfully forked the repository. If you have to create an account thatâ€™s ok, it wonâ€™t take long, just bare in mind that the username of your account will dictate the default url of your blog site e.g. <strong>yourUsername.github.io</strong></p>

<h2 id="its-all-in-the-name">Itâ€™s all in the name.</h2>
<p>Now that you have your fork youâ€™ll need to modify some settings to turn it into a hosted Github pages site. The first thing youâ€™ll want to do is rename the fork. Just a heads up, <em>what</em> you rename your repository to will dictate the final URL of your blog site. For example if you were to rename your repository â€œ<em>Blog</em>â€ your final URl would be <strong>yourUsername.github.io/blog</strong>, however, if you were to rename your repository to â€˜<em>yourUsername.github.io</em>â€ your blog site will be hosted directly under that domain so your final URL would simply be <strong>yourUsername.github.io</strong>.</p>

<p>Does this really matter?, well If you intend to host multiple sites, perhaps a blog and a portfolio then naming your repository to â€œ<em>Blog</em>â€ or â€œ<em>Portfolio</em>â€ now is probably the best option, but if you only plan on having one site keeping the content directly under the root domain just makes it a little easier for those visiting your site. Itâ€™s also worth noting this isnâ€™t something that needs to be decided right away, you can rename your repository at any point in time if you change your mind at a later date.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, to rename your repository simply head over to settings, update the repository name and click <em>Rename</em>.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-3.png"><img src="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-3.png" alt="Rename repostiory" class="page-embedded-image" /></a></p>

<h2 id="a-branch-to-call-your-own">A branch to call your own.</h2>
<p>The next step is technically optional but one that I feel makes your life just little bit easier for little effort and helps to keep your options open later when it comes to keeping up to date with your chosen themes feature improvements. First youâ€™ll want to rename the current main branch of the forked repository, likely named master or main, to â€œ<em>fork</em>â€. This well help keep your blog separated from the themes code.</p>

<p>To rename the main branch simply select the â€œBranchesâ€ sub menu on the settings page and click the little pencil icon next to the main branch.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-4.png"><img src="/assets/img/2021-02-14/screen-4.png" alt="Rename fork" class="page-embedded-image" /></a></p>

<p>This will bring up a little pop-up that will let you rename the main branch. The next part of the optional step is to create a new main branch, the Github <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch">documentation</a> can show you how to do this, you can call this branch whatever you want, I usually go with â€œ<em>main</em>â€ for simplicity but itâ€™s not essential, just be sure to remember what you called it for later on.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-or-it-soon-will-be">Itâ€™s Aliveâ€¦ or it soon will be.</h2>
<p>Right now all we have is well named repository, a couple of branches and a lot of code weâ€™re not likely to ever read, but itâ€™s not a live blog site yet. Youâ€™ll want to head back over to the main sub menu of the settings page and scroll <em>allllllllll</em> the way to the bottom, just above the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E">â€˜<em>Danger Zone</em>â€™</a>, and here is where youâ€™ll turn all of this into a blog site.</p>

<p>In the section â€œGithub Pagesâ€ youâ€™ll see sub section called â€œSourceâ€. All you need to do is set the branch to your newly created main branch, click save and youâ€™re blog site will be live.</p>
