<p>The purpose of the Wireless Communication project (referred to in this report as
the ‚ÄúWC Project‚Äù) is to learn the essential skill of wireless communication
between Arduino boards, as well as reinforce time management and collaborative
skills.</p>

<p>The first skill acquired through the completion of the WC Project is the
essential skill of wireless communication between Arduino boards, which had not
been explored to date in the course. These basic wireless communication skills
have a wide range of applications for various more sophisticated projects.</p>

<p>The second skill reinforced through the completion of the WC Project is time
management and collaboration. The WC Project requires a partner to use his
Arduino and wireless module as the transmitter or receiver for communication.
Working on a project of this type with a partner adds a new layer of complexity
in terms of time management and collaboration skills needed in order to
successfully complete the project.</p>

<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>

<p>The WC Project is made up of two unique circuits. The first circuit is the
transmitter, which consists of an Arduino connected to a wireless module. The
second circuit acts as the receiver, consisting of an Arduino, wireless module
and an LED Matrix Shield. However, the LED Matrix Shield designed by the
undersigned was not initially the display device. The initial display device was
an LED bar graph, which displayed the characters sent by the transmitter in
their binary form. Students were encouraged to improve the base circuit that
used a bar graph. The undersigned and his partner selected the LED Matrix Shield
to display the letters sent over wireless, as opposed to their binary
representation. With both circuits completed, Arduino code is used to set one
circuit as the transmitter and the other as the receiver, transmitting the data
by entering it into the serial monitor.</p>
