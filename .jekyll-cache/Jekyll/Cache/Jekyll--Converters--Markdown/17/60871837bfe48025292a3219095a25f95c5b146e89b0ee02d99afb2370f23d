<p>The purpose of the Assembly Binary Game Project (referred to in this report as
the “ABG Project”) is to provide a hardware substitute for the now defunct
online Cisco Binary Game. The binary challenge was a competition amongst junior
ACES where a tournament is held to see who can achieve the highest score in a
fixed amount of time. The ABG Project aims to allow students to hold this
competition using physical hardware consoles instead of websites like the Cisco
Binary Game, which ultimately ended up being placed behind a paywall. The custom
PCB allows for many ABG consoles to be created for a potential class set for
future ACES students to continue the binary challenge tradition.</p>

<p>The ABG Project allowed the undersigned to improve both assembly language skills
and PCB design skills. As the entire project’s code is written in assembly, the
ABG Project serves as a good introduction to writing complex and fully featured
programs in assembly language. The PCB was also found to be one of the most
complex through hole boards that the undersigned has designed to date, due in
part to the large number of components as well as unique and unfamiliar
components that were used by the undersigned on the PCB, such as transistors.</p>
