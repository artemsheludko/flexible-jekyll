<p>The purpose of the Astable Multivibrator project (the “AM”) was to learn
essential circuitry skills for the ACES program, as well as translate those
skills into a fun media, by creating a lighting system for a Halloween
“jack-o-lantern” pumpkin. There are three key circuitry skills that were
acquired by completing the AM project.</p>
