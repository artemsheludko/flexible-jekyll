<p>The purpose of the Wireless Communication project (referred to in this report as
the “WC Project”) is to learn the essential skill of wireless communication
between Arduino boards, as well as reinforce time management and collaborative
skills.</p>

<p>The first skill acquired through the completion of the WC Project is the
essential skill of wireless communication between Arduino boards, which had not
been explored to date in the course. These basic wireless communication skills
have a wide range of applications for various more sophisticated projects.</p>

<p>The second skill reinforced through the completion of the WC Project is time
management and collaboration. The WC Project requires a partner to use his
Arduino and wireless module as the transmitter or receiver for communication.
Working on a project of this type with a partner adds a new layer of complexity
in terms of time management and collaboration skills needed in order to
successfully complete the project.</p>
