<p>The purpose of the Astable Multivibrator project (the “AM”) was to learn
essential circuitry skills for the ACES program, as well as translate those
skills into a fun media, by creating a lighting system for a Halloween
“jack-o-lantern” pumpkin. There are three key circuitry skills that were
acquired by completing the AM project.</p>

<p>The first skill was to move from a prototype circuit on a breadboard to a final
product soldered to a Printed Circuit Board (a “PCB”). A PCB is a thin board
made of fibreglass, composite epoxy or a different laminate material and
contains electrically conductive pathways. Components can be installed and
connected to the pathways of a PCB to create a circuit. The PCB is a ubiquitous
component of computers and other electronics, hence the necessity of mastering
this skill.</p>

<p>The second skill was to learn proper techniques for soldering
components to a PCB. Proper soldering techniques are essential to ensuring the
proper functioning of the components. The third skill was to interpret the
circuit diagram provided for the project and successfully translate it to a
prototype circuit on the breadboard, and ultimately to a final product on a PCB.</p>
