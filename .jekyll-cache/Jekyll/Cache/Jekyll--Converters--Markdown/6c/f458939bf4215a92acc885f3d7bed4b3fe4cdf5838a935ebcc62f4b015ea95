<p>The purpose of the BiColor LED Matrix Project (referred to in this report as the
“BCLM”) is to improve the abilities of grade 11 ACES students in utilizing
registers and bitwise operators through mid-level C programming. The BCLM
project also serves as an opportunity for grade 11 students to be introduced to
lower level programming, which will be further expanded upon in grade 12.</p>

<p>The first skill obtained in the BCLM project is the use of various bitwise
operators such as left shift, right shift, bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise
NOT. The use of these operators gives lower level access to the registers of the
microcontroller and therefore makes for more efficient programs.</p>

<p>The second skill acquired in the BCLM project is register manipulation on a
microcontroller, which was used to form images on the LED Matrix and will be a
very important skill for students who pursue the grade 12 ACES course.</p>

<p>Lastly, the essential skill of soldering is improved upon in the BCLM project as the BiColor
LED Matrix used for the project is hand soldered.</p>
