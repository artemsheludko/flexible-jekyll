I"§<p>Welcome to the inaugural post of yet another blog site.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve stumbled across my humble blog site, thank you, I hope you will find something here of interest and maybe learn some things along the way. As you may have guessed from the name of the site this blog will primarily cover software development and securityâ€¦ and maybe bread making :P</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been a software developer for about 7 years now and Iâ€™ve been in the security space for over a year. I code here and there in my free time but have little to show for it, itâ€™s more exciting to start a new personal project than to finish an old one. That is why Iâ€™ve created this blog, to give myself a reason to finish my projects and have something to show for the time invested.</p>

<p>For my first series of posts Iâ€™m going ultra-meta, like a coffee table book about coffee tables, stay tuned for a blog series aboutâ€¦ building a blog site!</p>
