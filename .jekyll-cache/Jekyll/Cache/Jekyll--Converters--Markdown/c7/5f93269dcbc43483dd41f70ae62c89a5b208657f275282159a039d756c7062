<p>The purpose of the BiColor LED Matrix Project (referred to in this report as the
â€œBCLMâ€) is to improve the abilities of grade 11 ACES students in utilizing
registers and bitwise operators through mid-level C programming. The BCLM
project also serves as an opportunity for grade 11 students to be introduced to
lower level programming, which will be further expanded upon in grade 12.</p>
