I"-j<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>

<p>The purpose of the BiColor LED Matrix Project (referred to in this report as the
“BCLM”) is to improve the abilities of grade 11 ACES students in utilizing
registers and bitwise operators through mid-level C programming. The BCLM
project also serves as an opportunity for grade 11 students to be introduced to
lower level programming, which will be further expanded upon in grade 12.</p>

<p>The first skill obtained in the BCLM project is the use of various bitwise
operators such as left shift, right shift, bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise
NOT. The use of these operators gives lower level access to the registers of the
microcontroller and therefore makes for more efficient programs.</p>

<p>The second skill acquired in the BCLM project is register manipulation on a
microcontroller, which was used to form images on the LED Matrix and will be a
very important skill for students who pursue the grade 12 ACES course.</p>

<p>Lastly, the essential skill of soldering is improved upon in the BCLM project as
the BiColor LED Matrix used for the project is hand soldered.</p>

<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>

<p>The BCLM project consists of a 4x4 BiColor LED Matrix and an ATtiny84
microcontroller. 8 digital pins are required to control the LED Matrix. The
ATtiny84 has two ports: PORTA and PORTB. The LED Matrix is hooked up to PORTA in
the circuit as PORTA holds a full 8 pins on ATtiny84 while PORTB does not. By
hooking up the LED Matrix to PORTA, the whole matrix can be controlled from one
register. The fact that the LED Matrix can be controlled from one register is
very useful when programming since students have to use register manipulation
instead of Arduino functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digitalWrite()</code>. The construction of the BCLM
project is broken up into the following 3 steps; soldering and circuit
construction, animation planning and programming of the aforementioned
animations.</p>

<p>The first step of the BCLM project’s construction was to solder the LED Matrix.
The soldering process proved to be difficult as the legs of each LED had to be
properly insulated with heat shrink to prevent contact between different LED
leads that would cause a short circuit. In instances where heat shrink was
omitted by the undersigned in error, the risk of a short circuit from leads of
two different LEDs accidentally connecting was somewhat alleviated by using
pliers to create the largest distance between leads as possible.</p>

<p>Another issue during the soldering process was keeping the LEDs aligned in an
even grid. The alignment issue was solved by using a 3D printed matrix jig
(pictured on the right) for hand soldering LED matrices. The jig kept the LEDs
evenly spaced and made it easier to solder. Once the soldering was complete, the
matrix was placed in the breadboard. The PORTA pins on the ATtiny84 were hooked
up sequentially along the matrix from PA0 to PA7. Specifically, the upper nibble
of PORTA was connected to the row pins of the LED Matrix while the lower nibble
was connected to the columns.</p>

<p>The second step of constructing the BCLM project was to plan out what animations
would be shown on the LED Matrix. Creating an animated pattern involved planning
out the value for the PORTA and DDRA registers for each frame of the animation.
Both the PORTA and DDRA registers consist of 8 bits, the behaviour of the PORTA
pins on the ATtiny84 is controlled by the values inside of both these two
registers. The DDRA register is the data direction register for PORTA. For
instance, setting the bit to a 1 at position 0 in the DDRA register would set
the corresponding PA0 pin to be an output. On the other hand, setting it to a
zero would make it an input. The PORTA register controls the state of the pins
assigned to PORTA on the ATtiny84. For example, setting the bit at position 7 to
a 1 on the PORTA register would cause pin PA7 to go high while a 0 would cause
it to go low. However, the ability to set pins high and low on PORTA can only be
utilized when those pins are set to output in the DDRA register, which is why
both registers must be used in tandem to create matrix animations. The process
of creating images on the LED Matrix was simplified by a planning sheet provided
to all grade 11 students, which helped the undersigned visualize the image and
see what values would be required in each register to display the desired image.
The planning sheet also reintroduced the use of hexadecimal numbering, which is
a far more concise way than expressing the value on each register as binary.</p>

<p>The final and most difficult step in the construction of the BCLM project was
writing the code. The process of writing the code began with creating more
simple animations that utilized bitwise operators, iteration and delays as
opposed to playing through a “hard coded” set of bitmaps. Each of these simple
animations were placed in their own functions that were called in void <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loop()</code>.
Once the simple animations were complete, more complex functions requiring
persistence of vision (POV) were pursued in void <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loop()</code>. The use of POV allowed
for irregular shapes that could not be shown in a single image but in multiple
images displayed rapidly enough to look as though they are one. Please refer to
the report on the TBMA project for additional information about how POV works.
Pictured below is an image shown on the LED Matrix that relies on POV.</p>

<center><b>Breadboard Prototype</b></center>

<p>The first step in setting up POV was to design a structure to more closely
relate the unique data that is stored in each register for each frame in the POV
image. The structure created was called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regPair</code>. The structure contained a
variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">port</code> and another variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ddr</code> which stores the data for
both of those registers in one structure.</p>

<p>The second step to set up POV was to initialize a timer overflow interrupt that
would change which image was displayed at regular time intervals. A timer
overflow interrupt was required for POV because using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delay()</code> function would
stop the loop for the specified amount of time, thereby destroying the POV
effect, which required the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loop()</code> function to be running at full speed without
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delay()</code>. However, upon initializing TIMER1 and creating the interrupt service
routine (ISR), the code inside the ISR would not run no matter the frequency of
the interrupt. Following some troubleshooting, it was determined that timer
overflow interrupts were not supported when programming the ATtiny84 on the
Arduino IDE, resulting in the ISR being ignored by the compiler. Following this
determination, it was concluded that the timing needed for POV without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delay()</code>
could be created by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">millis()</code> function. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">millis()</code> function returns
the number of milliseconds that have passed since the Arduino started running.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">millis()</code> function was exploited by detecting every passing of the desired
interval of time and running code to move on the next frame of the POV animation
without the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delay()</code>.</p>

<p>he third and final step of setting up POV was to write the code needed to
display the bit maps. The medium used to hold all of the POV images was a two
dimensional array of regPair structures called pov. A two dimensional array can
be thought of as an “array of arrays”. In each array within the array was a set
of regPair structures that when played through quickly enough would assemble one
unique image, which could take advantage of both LED colors. A function called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showImage()</code> was developed to display the contents of the pov array. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showImage()</code> function took a single dimension regPair array and the number of
structures in it as arguments. The function used a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for()</code> loop to play through
all of the array’s contents without delay forming the singular POV image. Once
the desired time interval passed, a variable called currentFrame was incremented
by 1 thereby changing which array the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showImage()</code> function was accessing by
moving on to another array with the two dimensional pov array. Using this model
for displaying the images has the advantage that only the two dimensional array
needs to be changed in order to change what is shown onscreen.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>The BLCM project serves as a strong introduction to lower level programming and
as a preview to the grade 12 ACES’ course where students will be introduced to
assembly language. In particular, the project served as an excellent
introduction to various bitwise operators and the operation of a microcontroller
without the assistance of Arduino functionality.</p>
