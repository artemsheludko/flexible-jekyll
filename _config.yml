about-author: I am a data professional focusing on solving technical problems through data! What I lack in data depth, I make up for in breadth. I have a diverse background of experience from my Mechanical Engineering background, including Robotics. I also am an avid DIYer and have built my own CNC router, built a basement bathroom, and a built a bunch of furniture around my house. I believe learning is a journey, not a destination and I love the journey. # add description
